# Masters-Project-2019
This is a repository containing my old project files for my mathematics master's project.
The PDF report is available in the 'Report and Results' file.

The concept of this project is modelling self-propelling particles using the Vicsek model:

It contains three main applications: one with default rules, one with a restriction on the number of particale neighbours and one with two different particle types


These are old files from my 2019 project so please note the following: 
 - This project will require Gnuplot to run and I have not tested the functionality of the applications since completing my project.
 - The applications require a gnuplot.h pipeline file which I did not write (I will link at the bottom of the README)
 - This project was written in a simple procedural way which is how it was taught on the mathematics course and before I had learned OOP and more modern C++ (It is a goal of mine to update/refactor this as a personal project)
